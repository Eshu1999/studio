/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for DocConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user- and doctor-ownership model. Each user and doctor can only
 * access their own profile data. Appointments are stored under both users and doctors to allow
 * for easier querying and are secured based on ownership. Consultation summaries are also
 * protected under the user's appointment path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the user.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Doctor profiles, accessible only by the doctor.
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Appointments scheduled by the user, accessible only by the user.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Appointments scheduled with the doctor, accessible only by the doctor.
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}/consultation_summaries/{consultationSummaryId}: Consultation summaries, accessible only by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users and doctors can only create, read, update, and delete their own profiles.
 * - Appointments can only be created, read, updated, and deleted by the user or doctor involved.
 * - Consultation summaries can only be created, read, updated, and deleted by the user who scheduled the appointment.
 * - No user listing is allowed for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The rules assume that the 'Appointment' documents contain denormalized data such as user and doctor IDs.
 * This avoids costly `get()` calls in the security rules.
